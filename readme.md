# Notion Toolkit
A simplified wrapper for the Notion sdk used to quickly interact with simple databases.
The main purpose is to abstract some of the object structures required and returned by the Notion API.
It is used to automate tasks that involve reading and creating many pages.

### Auth
Create .env file and set `NOTION_KEY` to your api key

### Database Type Declarations
  - [X] Check that given schema and database type match
  - [ ] Cover all property types supported by Notion


## Notes
  * query doesn't return property values, only ids
  * pages.retrieve returns property values
